            <p style="font-size: 30px;">In its classic quirky fashion, Portland's six main geographical sections (North, Northeast, Northwest, South, Southeast and Southwest) are referred to by residents as the city's "quadrants." The city is divided into north and south by Burnside Street and into east and west by the Willamette River.  Portland actually has more than 90 formally recognized neighborhoods with distinct boundaries.</p>
