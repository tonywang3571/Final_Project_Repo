## Pearl District
### Zipcode 97209

If you love dining out, then the Pearl District is the neighborhood for you. Located in the heart of downtown, it’s one of the city’s most desirable neighborhoods for young professionals looking for a great nightlife. But it’s also great for families with young kids who want to be close to family-friendly activities. The Pearl, as it’s called, used to be full of warehouses and work yards but has been transformed into a place filled with upscale, world-famous restaurants, art galleries, and classy boutiques. This area is very walkable with many residents opting to get rid of their cars in favor of public transit, bikes, and their own two feet. The Pearl District Neighborhood Association is also strong and is a great place to get to know more about the district.
